    <p class="justTxt">I graduated cum laude with an animation degree from an accredited university. After graduation and discovering that the movie and videogame animation fields no longer appealed to me, I decided to learn as much as possible about web development. Since 2004 I have become proficient with web coding and created a few HTML/CSS websites. I am passionate about the Internet and would like to contribute to it. </p>

    <p class="justTxt">I enjoy solving problems. I always look for faster, more efficient methods to reach the best results and I bring this mindset to my development projects. I look at problems from different viewpoints and consider several approaches. The more details I can learn about a language or browswer the better.</p>
    
    <p class="justTxt">My strengths lie in coding, especially frontend code. Recreating mock-up designs in HTML/CSS is easy for me. I also actively seek new knowledge. After discovering a Javascript-based animation library called Greensock, I plan to learn as much as possible about it because of my love for the art of animation.</p>
